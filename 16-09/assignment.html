  <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
  <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
  <p>
    I love painting because it lets me express feelings visually. I especially enjoy <b>mixing colors</b>,
    I feel <i>calm</i>, and sometimes I <u>teach</u> friends simple techniques.
  </p>

  <h3>How I Started</h3>
  <p>
    I started painting when I was ten after attending a community art class. A teacher showed me
    how to blend colors and I was hooked.
